This repo is intended to store code used as part of my Sept-Dec 2019 work term report, where I compare the accuracy of a Linear model and a XGBoost model for the purposes of insurance pricing.

As this report is fairly high level, the models here are intended to be more of a proof of concept then anything rigorous.
