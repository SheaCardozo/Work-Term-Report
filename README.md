This repo is intended to store work down as part of my Sept-Dec 2019 work term report, where I compare the accuracy of a Tweedie Distributed GLM and a XGBoost model for the purposes of insurance pricing.

As this report is intended to be fairly high level, the models here are intended to be more of a proof of concept then anything rigorous.
